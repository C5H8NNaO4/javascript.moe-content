## [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in a code project and collaborate efficiently with others. Key concepts include _repositories_, _branches_, _commits_, and _pull requests_.

An effective branching model helps to cleanly separate features, bugfixes, and releases. Feature branches are merged into a release branch once the [_Definition of Done_](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-definition-done) is met.

When working in a team, understanding `git merge` and `git rebase` is essential. `rebase` ensures a linear history, while `merge` preserves structure. For clean commits when merging into the release branch, it's recommended to use `--no-ff` to maintain history and traceability.

Anyone who masters these concepts can use Git confidently in everyday project work.
